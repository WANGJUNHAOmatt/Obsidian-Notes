To do something well you have to love it.

It was not till I was in college that the idea of work finally broke free from the idea of making a living.

If your work is not your favorite thing to do, you will have terrible problems with procrastination. You will have to force yourself to work, and when you resort to that the result are distinctly inferior.

To be happy I think you have to be doing something you not only enjoy, but admire. You have to be able to say, at the end, wow, that's pretty cool. This doesn't mean you have to make something. If you learn how to hang glide, or to speak a foreign language fluently, that will be enough to make you say, for a while at least, wow, that's pretty cool. What there has to be is a test.

It might be a good rule simply to avoid any prestigious task. If it didn't suck, they wouldn't have to had to make it prestigious.

The other big force leading people astray is money. Money by itself is not that dangerous. When something pays well but is regarded with contempt, like telemarketing, or prostitution, or personal injury litigation, ambitious people aren't tempted by it. That kind of work ends up being done by people who are "just trying to make a living." (Tip: avoid any field whose practitioners say this.)

> 只是为了生活而工作的人，如何热爱他的工作呢？又如何提供好的服务呢？

The test of whether people love what they do is whether they'd do it even if they weren't paid for it—even if they had to work at another job to make a living.

> 测试是否一个人是否热爱一个事，就要看他是否愿意再即使没有报酬的时候继续做下去。
